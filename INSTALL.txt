To install: 

`opam install Graphics`
`make build` 

To launch the game, run: 
    `make main` 
You are first taken to the welcome screen. 
Press any key to start the first round. 
In this, you control movements to navigate the maze with `w` `a` `s` `d` 
    Quit at any time with `0`. (Note, currently sometimes enemies are generated
    right near the beginning, so you die immediately)
Once the game ends, either via you getting hit by an enemy or you completing 
all of the mazes, you will see your final score. Press `0` to exit when done.
