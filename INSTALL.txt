To install: 

`opam install Graphics`
`make build` 
Since the files containing the images are so large, this may take a 
while to load. Please allow at least 5 minutes on the first run of `make build` 
On subsequent runs, the cache will make it run much faster. 

To launch the game, run: 
    `make main` 
You are first taken to the welcome screen. 
Press any key and follow the instructions on the screen to play. 

Once the game ends, either via you getting hit by an enemy or you completing 
all of the mazes, you will see your final score. Press `0` to exit when done.
