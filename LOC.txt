The image matrices in [background.ml], [words.ml], [constant.ml], 
[words.ml] and file names beginning [img] 
result in the inflation of LOC. 

Roughly subtract the counts from the aforementioned files
from the result of [cloc --by-file --include-lang=OCaml .] 
to yield the main substantive LOC count.
